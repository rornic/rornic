### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rory, a Software Engineer based in London.

I like to focus mostly on backend, infra and tooling projects with a sprinkle of Svelte and game dev here and there.

Iâ€™m currently working on: [findatechjob.io](https://findatechjob.io/jobs), [rustcraft](https://github.com/rornic/rustcraft) and [starling_exporter](https://github.com/rornic/starling_exporter).
